# Spotify-Data-Analysis
This Spotify Music Analysis Dashboard is built using Power BI, focusing on streaming trends, track popularity, and artist insights.
I used DAX, Power Query, and Power BI's visualization tools to analyze billions of streams.
This project strengthened my data analytics, data modeling, and visualization skills. The best part was creating interactive visuals that transform complex data into actionable insights.
This project showcases my business intelligence expertise, helping users explore music trends efficiently.
